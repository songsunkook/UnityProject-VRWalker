If we talk about the game, it's just a demonstration of what can be done in a hurry.

The meaning of the game, push the enemy off the cliff.
Game for 2 people.

P.S. I'm not a programmer and I did the game, by tutorials from Unity, so I can not be responsible for the correctness of the code.

Thanks for the support! Good luck!
